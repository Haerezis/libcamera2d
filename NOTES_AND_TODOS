Techniques to implement :
-single focus position lock. offset -> position
-dual focus position lock. offets -> position, direction
-windows lock. bounds positions -> position
-auto-scroll. start-end position, time -> time delta

Transformation:
-snapping. null -> boolean
-manual panning. null -> int
-push scrolling (mario style : can't go back). null -> null

Smoothing:
-lerp / EaseOut. null -> coeff, time
-speedup pullup zone
-lerp + camera velocity memory (camera physics) / EaseInOut
-focus (attractor). list of attractors infos -> list of attractors infos
